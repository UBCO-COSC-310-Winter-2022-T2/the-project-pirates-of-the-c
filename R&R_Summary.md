1. Highlight what tasks were done during this cycle (by owner).   They will come from your Kanban board or tracking tool. Recall that there is an expectation of on-average, equal contribution to the project.

Kyle Keim (46335485) - Continuing to write tests and implement the database for the project. Working on containerizing using docker and implementing possibly using a 
flask framework for moving data between the python backend and the database.

Ryan Tschritter (47341862) - Finished writing the test for the simulated sensor. I've been researching docker and getting a better understanding of the mid level architecture that we'll have to implement. I've looked into docker compose as a possibility for the final solution as well as networking between containers.

Mehul Raisingh (46168746) -  Currently still working on creating a bandpass filter. I have started to looking into including a PID systems that would help improve the control system. Currently still deciding the which API to use and how to implment it again.


Einar Schiele (64296734) -  




2. Summary of the progress (relative to the requirements for the project (where are you based on where you thought you were going to be;  what's done and what's left) (this will be supported by your commit logs; remember that each feature needs to be on its own branch, tested, reviewed and merged)

Kyle Keim - "I would have liked to be a bit furthur along on my current task, but life gets in the way sometimes lol. A lot of broken code and python deployment errors attempting to get a mySQL framework up and running but it's coming along slowly. I have more time this week to hopefully keep up with the project on the daily. We will get together to discuss project details by the end of the week."

Ryan Tschritter - "I think we are still on track for our project requirements are we should have some hard deliverables starting to appear in the next few days. I think a group meeting is also in order to get everybody caught up and show what we've been working on."

Mehul Raisingh - added intial function components for the bandpass filter and its asocciated tests.

Einar Schiele - 

3. Comments on the process;  how is the process you selected as a team working?  Does anything need to change?

We selected a Kanban style work process that allows use to easily see whose working on what, what needs to be done, and what is already completed. It will help give us a good sense of what needs to be done and where we are at. I think that the Kanban process has given us a better idea of how we are managing the scope of the project and how much time we have left to complete it.


4. Branches/Tasks completed and tested/merged 

5. If you have a release candidate (something that is working, even partially, make note of that (this could be on your master branch, or you might choose to branch from master onto a release branch.  

No current release candidate available as of Milestone #5 (03/April/2023).

6. Update your testing report so you know what is working.  What's working; what's passing; what's not? 

The testing report will be updated as more of the project becomes available.
